# Left-atrial-single-cell-transcriptomics-for-atrial-fibrillation

We analyse single-cell and nuclei RNA sequencing data from left atrial tissues of patients with atrial fibrillation. The code is written in R and uses the Seurat package.

In the Seurat folder, there are code for analysis of single-cell and nuclei RNA sequencing data using Seurat. The Cellchat folder cantains code for the Cellchat analysis.
